# Spryker Feature: Product Bundles

Tie individual items together and sell them as a package. Items in a bundle are always sold together. Apply a special bundle price to make the purchase more attractive. Bundle availability is calculated and displayed based on the item with the smallest available stock to avoid overselling.
